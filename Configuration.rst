Configuration
===================================

This section assumes you've already installed Bazooka and packaged your applciation and will guide trough the necessary steps to configure and deploy your first application.

Creating your first user
-------------------------

The first thing to do is to login into Bazooka. Point your browser at the URL assigned during website creation and you will reach the login screen.


The first thing to do is to create your first user by clicking the **Create an account** link. You will see the account creation page where you can input the new user data. 

.. Note:: if you have chosen to use Active Directory authentication use the same password to create the user as it will be validated against your Active Directory Controller

.. Note:: The first user created in the system will be automatically an Administrator with full privileges. This can be changed later if it is not adequate.
