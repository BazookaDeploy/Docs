Walktrough
===================================

Bazooka has many different sections in its interface so it's useful to walk trough them one at a time.

Dashboard
-------------------------

The first section and the one you''l see once you login is the **Dashboard**. here you can see at  a glance the status of the entire system (or the part of it you are allowed to see). For each application and every enviroment where you have access it is shown the currently deployed version allowing you to quicily deploy a new version.

Optionally you can define groups of applications to more easily organize them visually. These groups can be then ordered by pressing the **Modify** button in the top left cornet and then ajdusting the position with the arrow buttons on each application group.

Deployments
-------------------------

The second tab and one of the most used is the **Deployments** tab. In this tab you can see your last deployments. For each deployment the first column indicates its state while on the rest of the line you can see the application / Enviroment where the deploy is happening, the user who launched it and the relative time it started.


By clicking on a deploy we can see its status in more detail. If the deploy is still running its status will be automatically refreshed every 10 seconds.


On the top left corner a drop-down will allow you to view older deployments
