Walktrough
===================================

Bazooka has many different sections in its interface so it's useful to walk trough them one at a time.

Dashboard
-------------------------

The first section and the one you''l see once you login is the **Dashboard**. here you can see at  a glance the status of the entire system (or the part of it you are allowed to see). For each application and every enviroment where you have access it is shown the currently deployed version allowing you to quicily deploy a new version.

Optionally you can define groups of applications to more easily organize them visually. These groups can be then ordered by pressing the **Modify** button in the top left cornet and then ajdusting the position with the arrow buttons on each application group.

Deployments
-------------------------

The second tab and one of the most used is the **Deployments** tab.
