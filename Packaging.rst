Packaging
===================================

Packaging your application
---------------------------

Bazooka works on a simple idea: if an application can be packaged with all his dependencies and configurations and versioned then that package can be used to deploy the application in various enviroments in a repeatable way.


Packaging format
---------------------------

To package the applications we had to choose a format. Ideally it should be:

- versionable  as every package should be easily marked with a version number
- easy to create an modify with existing tools as you probably alreaady have a build or CI system and it should be easily to produce the packages from it
